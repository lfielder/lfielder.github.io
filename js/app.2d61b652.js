During these sessions we leveraged previous research and business needs to make intial decisions about our long term plan for what we termed the &quot;Support Platform&quot;. We new that the long term goal of this project was to revolutionize the way we deliver support to customers and increase their visibility for the work we perform for them. </p><h5>Kickoff</h5><p> As with most successful projects, we held a kickoff week that included lead dev, product management, and design. It also includes multiple check-ins with project sponsors and key stakeholders. During the kickoff we established key milestones as well as the long term north-star vision for where this project could go. </p><p> Our first deliverable was documenting the user stories, prioritizing those stories, and then documenting the user workflows for these stories. </p><div class="col-xs-12"><h5>High Level Requirements</h5><img class="post-img" src="'+Pe+'"><h5>Rough Architecture Diagram</h5><img class="post-img" src="'+We+'"><h5>User Stories</h5><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=13-q8vMQJISx5G0tyUBk-AdcYC4js0aeY"><img class="post-img" src="'+je+'"></a></div><div class="col-xs-12"><h5>User Workflows</h5><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dQozBjiKAMozMgVyhUGUlVj5oUsCWCsT" target="_blank"><img class="post-img" src="'+Ue+'"></a></div><h5>Milestone 1 - MVP</h5><p> Our MVP was initially focused on our dedicated hosting customers, but was switched to our public cloud customers due to requests from key customers and prospects. During this MVP phase we were able to introduce the side-by-side layout, create ticket flow, classifications, categorization, and severity. They big key feature for these users, and the main reason they were selected for our MVP release, was the need to create support tickets on specific sub-accounts that previously were not able to be associated with the tickets. This increased support productivity and customer confidence that their issue would be focused on the right infrastructure. </p><p> I created an invision project that was used as the source of truth for our development teams. This allowed us to make decisions in meetings, and I could update the source of truth without worry that developers might have out of date mockups.

It introduced additional features previously not available to cloud users like ticket favoriting and ticket templates. It also required us to adhear to one-off decisions made by the previous ticketing portal. Custom routing logic for specific customers and even one-off features for specific customers. </p><p> I was able to work very closely with our API team to develop APIs that would accomodate current features, but be scalable for the future. </p><div class="col-xs-12"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18odSLWA96poPnbDMtBcmnX74Nw0SYgsI" target="_blank"><img class="post-img" src="'+Oe+'"></a></div><div class="col-xs-12"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sjw9MNHHnpPuweVW8oF_pfvuyh9NrePi" target="_blank"><img class="post-img" src="'+Ee+'"></a></div><h5>Milestone 3 - Service Now Integration</h5><p> Currently in development. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p> This was one of the most complex project I have worked on.

While I was able to collaborate and get feedback from other designers, the context and background information required to make informed design decisions hindered my ability to do this as often as I would have liked.

Our mission was to tackle persistent challenges related to inconsistent user interfaces and the inefficient design processes across our diverse product portfolio. As the <b>design manager</b> and<b> product owner</b>, I oversaw the design, development, and implementation of a robust design system to elevate user experiences and streamline product development.</p><h2>Problem Statement</h2><p>Earlier this year, Rackspace faced several user experience challenges, which included:</p><p><strong>Inconsistent UI</strong> Different product teams had been operating with varying design aesthetics and styles, resulting in a disjointed user experience.</p><p><strong>Increased Development Time</strong> Designers and developers were dedicating significant time reinventing the wheel, leading to longer development cycles and delayed product releases.</p><p><strong>Scalability Issues</strong> Rackspace had many UI dev teams across the company. Our design team could not support the number of developers and these developers needed something easy to implement.</p><h2>Approach</h2><h3>Research and Analysis</h3><p>Our team conducted extensive user research, including surveys and interviews, to gain deep insights into user pain points and preferences and a comprehensive audit of existing design assets was carried out, identifying redundancies and inconsistencies. We identified over 4 previous design system and UI frameworks that were created/developed in the void of an easy to use out of the box design system solution. Speicifcally, we highlighted the need for a react bootstrap theme to provide a &quot;turn-key&quot; solution for our development teams that are working on Fabric Platform UIs.</p><h3>Milestone 1</h3><p><strong>Design Tokens</strong>Our first milestone was to define the design tokens that could be used for any framework to implement the Fabric Design System for any UI at Rackspace. We started with color and typography as the critical foundations for the most broad visual consistency.</p><p><strong>React Bootstrap Theme</strong>The team then used these tokens and applied them to React Bootstrap framework to enable any teams that currently use React Bootstrap to adopt the design system as quickly as possible with the least amount of development work. Design did an initial, &quot;first-pass&quot; audit on components to ensure there were no major showstoppers. We found some around clarity for buttons vs labels and suggested development changes to resolve.</p><p><strong>Fabric Components</strong>Bootstrap provides a great foundation to start our component list. However, we found Rackspace has some use-cases that were not accounted for, but are common across multiple UIs. We started with header and footer components, and then moved to zero state page layouts. Some of the smaller components to be developed are around key value pairs and stats.</p><p><strong>Documentation and Maintenance</strong>To ensure the longevity of the design system, we meticulously documented design guidelines, usage instructions, and best practices. This included a <a href="https://zeroheight.com/0f6984d21/p/2046ba-introduction">ZeroHeight</a> site for design documentation and a <a href="https://manage.rackspace.com/rackspace-fabric-design-system/?path=/docs/home--docs">Storybook</a> site for development documentation.</p><h3>Milestone 2</h3><p><strong>Design Tokens</strong>Milestone 2 design tokens included spacing, box-shadows, and border radius.</p><p><strong>React Bootstrap Theme</strong> Designers did a full audit of the bootstrap theme and highlight changes needed to the bootstrap theme to resolve smaller issues not prioritized in milestone 1.</p><p><strong>Fabric Components</strong>Additional components are being designed and developed including list page and detail page layouts. Also a smaller component called Transfer Lists needed by multiple UIs for selecting multiple items from a larger list.</p><h2>Results</h2><p><strong>Consistent User Experience</strong>The implementation of the design system resulted in a unified look and feel across all products, significantly enhancing user satisfaction and reinforcing brand recognition.</p><p><strong>Efficiency Gains</strong>Our efforts led to a remarkable 30% reduction in development cycles. Designers and developers were liberated from starting from scratch, enabling faster product releases.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong>The design system proved highly adaptable to new UIs, drastically reducing the time and effort required for to create proof of concepts and time to market for new features.</p><p><strong>Positive User Feedback</strong>Our developers are our users. After milestone 1 was delivered, they highlighted an improved overall experience that translated into higher user engagement and adoption.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Our team, guided by industry best practices, successfully addressed the major shortcomings of the previous design system attempts. The Fabric Design System not only significantly improved the developer experience but also increased efficiency and scalability. This project exemplified our team&#39;s expertise and commitment, contributing to Rackspace&#39;s need to improve time to delivery and scale development time.</p></div></div></div>',1);function Jt(e,t,s,o,a,n){return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",Kt,[(0,i._)("div",Nt,[(0,i._)("div",Xt,[(0,i._)("h1",null,(0,x.zw)(e.title),1)])]),Gt])}const Yt={name:"ConsolidatedTicketing",data:function(){return{title:"Fabric Design System",role:"Product Owner"}}},Qt=(0,f.Z)(Yt,[["render",Jt]]),$t=Qt;var es={class:"case_study"},ts={class:"banner"},ss={class:"container"},os=(0,i.uE)('<div class="container"><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-9"><p>Early 2023, Rackspace Technology made a commitment and pivot to support and drive more services and less infrastructure. Multiple teams activated and began making varying service experiences. Product leadership, principal designer, and I were tasked with creating a strategy and plan for incorporating these experiences together and creating consistency across them. </p><h2>Problem Statement:</h2><p><strong>Inconsistent Service Experience:</strong> Different teams were creating products and services indipendently. As a user moved between services, their experience would vary widely on features and capabilities available.</p><p><strong>Increased Development Time:</strong> With no established patterns and strategy, teams were starting from scratch with every new service or product developed.</p><p><strong>Unclear Value Proposition:</strong> Rackspace was not well positioned to showcase the value the company provided to customers. It was difficult to understand and see what Rackspace was doing for a customer in the digital experience.</p><h2>Approach</h2><h3>Research and Analysis</h3><p>Our team conducted heurstic analysis of all our existing service platforms to identify common tasks and workflows. We then highlighted where these experiences differed the most. Some products do offer more capabilities and self-service in the portal than others and we had to account for this in our strategy and plan.</p><h3>Milestone 1</h3><p><strong>Design System Implementation:</strong>The first goal was to have all the experiences consuming the design system to ensure visual consistency.</p><p><strong>Common Experience Flows:</strong> The team identified 3 key experience flows that almost all the products and services had. Viewing current status, changing the status, removing items from coverage. We wanted to get crystal clear on these flows and how we defined them to ensure these were consistent regardless of service portal.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;"><span class="example">Example: Service Enrollment allowed users to add services to a sub-set of accounts, and Resources view allowed to add/remove services on individual resources.</span></p><p><strong>Circle Of Life Diagram:</strong>We termed this the &quot;Circle of Life Diagram&quot; because of the way it looked. In reality it defined what Rackspace&#39;s competitive advantage was and what experiences we wanted to hold sacred for our customers. This drove us to really focus on the connection between service providers and allow users the ability to use the provider&#39;s consoles when needed.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;"><span class="example">Example: We are not going to provide a way to create a terraform workflow. However, we do want to control the service experience a user will have when receiving support during an incident.</span></p><h3>Milestone 2</h3><p><strong>UI implementation:</strong>Resource view, Patching view, Service Enrollment</p><p>Most of this is unreleased at this moment, but I can provide visual examples of these in a private setting.</p><h2>Results</h2><p><strong>Consistent User Experience</strong>Regardless of what UI the user is in, there is a consistent experience. Not just in the look and feel, but even in the small interactions when performing an action. </p><p><strong>Clear Strategy</strong>Using our north star &quot;circle of life diagram&quot; we were able to galvanize product teams with an understanding of what we can focus on to have the largest impact for our customers.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong>Leveraging the design system, we were able to create fabric components for widely used interactions that developers used to have to develop from scratch.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Creating a vision and strategy that gave clarity to how the company goals manifested in the portal experience allowed all our developers, designers, and product teams to drive together towards the same goal. We are still in this process, but we think we have laid the groundwork to ensure success in the future.</p></div></div>',1);function is(e,t,s,o,a,n){return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",es,[(0,i._)("div",ts,[(0,i._)("div",ss,[(0,i._)("h1",null,(0,x.zw)(e.title),1)])]),os])}const as={name:"ConsolidatedTicketing",data:function(){return{title:"Fabric Platform & Strategy",role:"Product Owner"}}},ns=(0,f.Z)(as,[["render",is]]),rs=ns;s.p;s.p;s.p;s.p;var ls=[{path:"/",name:"home",component:J},{path:"/work",name:"work",component:Z},{path:"/resume",name:"Resume",component:oe},{path:"/contact",name:"Contact",component:he},{path:"/values",name:"TeamValues",component:ye},{path:"/principles",name:"Principles",component:Ie},{path:"/work/fabric_design_system",name:"FabricDesignSystem",component:$t},{path:"/work/fabric_platform",name:"FabricPlatform",component:rs},{path:"/work/consolidated_ticketing",name:"ConsoldatedTicketing",component:Ze},{path:"/work/computer_telephony",name:"ComputerTelephony",component:tt},{path:"/work/global_search",name:"GlobalSearch",component:ut},{path:"/work/origin_platform",name:"OriginPlatform",component:_t},{path:"/work/self_service",name:"selfService",component:qt},{path:"/work/surface_transformation",name:"surfaceTransformation",component:Bt}],cs=(0,_.p7)({history:(0,_.PO)("/"),routes:ls});const ds=cs;var ps=s(8970),hs=(0,o.ri)(k);hs.use(ds),hs.use(ps.ZP,{config:{id:"G-KJYX35B058"}},ds),hs.mount("#app")},4403:(e,t,s)=>{e.exports=s.p+"img/title_image.b02cde4f.png"},530:(e,t,s)=>{e.exports=s.p+"img/title_image.6dfcec48.jpg"},7134:(e,t,s)=>{e.exports=s.p+"img/title_image.cc3363e0.png"},9864:(e,t,s)=>{e.exports=s.p+"img/title_image.a3f2a364.png"}},t={};function s(o){var i=t[o];if(void 0!==i)return i.exports;var a=t[o]={exports:{}};return e[o](a,a.exports,s),a.exports}s.m=e,(()=>{var e=[];s.O=(t,o,i,a)=>{if(!o){var n=1/0;for(d=0;d<e.length;d++){for(var[o,i,a]=e[d],r=!0,l=0;l<o.length;l++)(!1&a||n>=a)&&Object.keys(s.O).every((e=>s.O[e](o[l])))?o.splice(l--,1):(r=!1,a<n&&(n=a));if(r){e.splice(d--,1);var c=i();void 0!==c&&(t=c)}}return t}a=a||0;for(var d=e.length;d>0&&e[d-1][2]>a;d--)e[d]=e[d-1];e[d]=[o,i,a]}})(),(()=>{s.n=e=>{var t=e&&e.__esModule?()=>e["default"]:()=>e;return s.d(t,{a:t}),t}})(),(()=>{s.d=(e,t)=>{for(var o in t)s.o(t,o)&&!s.o(e,o)&&Object.defineProperty(e,o,{enumerable:!0,get:t[o]})}})(),(()=>{s.g=function(){if("object"===typeof globalThis)return globalThis;try{return this||new Function("return this")()}catch(e){if("object"===typeof window)return window}}()})(),(()=>{s.o=(e,t)=>Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)})(),(()=>{s.p="/"})(),(()=>{var e={143:0};s.O.j=t=>0===e[t];var t=(t,o)=>{var i,a,[n,r,l]=o,c=0;if(n.some((t=>0!==e[t]))){for(i in r)s.o(r,i)&&(s.m[i]=r[i]);if(l)var d=l(s)}for(t&&t(o);c<n.length;c++)a=n[c],s.o(e,a)&&e[a]&&e[a][0](),e[a]=0;return s.O(d)},o=self["webpackChunkportfolio"]=self["webpackChunkportfolio"]||[];o.forEach(t.bind(null,0)),o.push=t.bind(null,o.push.bind(o))})();var o=s.O(void 0,[998],(()=>s(5364)));o=s.O(o)})();
