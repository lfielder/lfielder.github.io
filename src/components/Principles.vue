      <p>These principles are a good checklist to make sure the work we are doing is providing the business value and the team feels valuable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="value_list"><strong>Progress over perfection</strong><p>Do not let perfection get in the way of progress and delivery. If we wait until things are perfect, we delivered too late.</p></li>
        <li class="value_list"><strong>Measurable delivery</strong><p>Each milestone delivered should have success criteria that can be measured in the future to ensure our changes are having a positive impact.</p></li>
        <li class="value_list"><strong>Business Value</strong><p>Delivered work should be tied back to organization and business goals. Contributors should have an understanding of how what they are doing is impacting business goals.</p></li>
