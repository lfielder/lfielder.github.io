      <p class="home_text">My name is Lane Fielder. I am a Manager of User Experience at Racksapce Technology. I have a passion for leading and mentoring high performing teams. My strengths are bringing people together to accomplish a common goal and meet business needs. I pride myself in delivery measurable business value early and often in a project. </p>
      <p class="home_text">I currently manage a team of 14 people that includes developers, designers, content writers, and technical product managers. Our focus is core experience interfaces. This includes things like Ticketing, Account and User Management, and Service Enrollment. These UIs are unique at Rackspace in that they are a part of every customer's experience regardless of what products they own. </p>
      <p class="home_text">I am open to exploring a new opportunity. I am happy to take on a challenge with an existing team or help build a new team. My goal is to create a team environment to enable contributors to do their best work. I feel that people do their best work in a comfortable environment where fast failure is encouraged and delivery is paramount.</p>
